### Step 4: Track Used Keys
Keep a simple spreadsheet:

## ðŸ”— **Option 2: Gumroad Success Redirect (Semi-Automated)**

### Step 1: Set Up Success Redirect
1. In your Gumroad product settings
2. Find "Redirect URL after purchase"
3. Set it to: `https://yourdomain.com/premium?access=premium_snow_2025_abc123`

**Problem**: This gives the same key to everyone! Only use for testing.

### Step 2: Dynamic Keys (Requires Backend)
For unique keys per customer, you need a server that:
1. Receives Gumroad webhook
2. Generates unique key
3. Redirects customer to premium page with their key

## ðŸ¤– **Option 3: Full Automation (Advanced)**

### Step 1: Set Up Webhook Server
1. Use the provided `webhook-handler.js` 
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express nodemailer
   ```
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```
4. Deploy to Heroku, Vercel, or your server

### Step 2: Configure Gumroad Webhook
1. Go to Gumroad Settings â†’ Advanced
2. Set Webhook URL: `https://your-server.com/gumroad-webhook`
3. Enable "sale" events

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Make a test purchase on Gumroad
2. Check your webhook server logs
3. Customer should receive email with access key automatically
